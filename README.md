This project is a Blog Content Management System (CMS) built using FastAP
This project is a Blog Content Management System (CMS) developed using FastAPI. It enables users to register, verify their accounts through OTP, and manage their blog posts by creating, editing, or deleting them. To enhance user interaction, the platform allows only followers of a user to view their blog posts. Users can also engage by liking posts, adding comments, and reacting to comments.

Key features include comprehensive user authentication, where users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. The follow/unfollow functionality helps users connect and build networks, while post visibility is limited to followers for privacy control. Each blog post can be categorized and tagged, making it easier for users to organize and search through the content. The platform supports drafting and publishing posts, giving users flexibility in managing their content.

Search and filter capabilities improve the user experience by allowing posts to be searched by title, category, or tags and filtered by author or tags. Admins play a crucial role in content moderation, as they must approve blog posts before they are publicly visible. Through the admin dashboard, they can manage users, approve or delete posts, ban or unban users, and view platform statistics and analytics.

Additional functionalities include pagination for posts and comments to improve performance and user navigation. Admins can view pending posts for approval, monitor user activities, and manage all blog content, ensuring the platform remains safe and user-friendly.

Overall, the CMS provides a secure, interactive platform for users to create and share content while ensuring admin control over public visibility, content moderation, and user management. This scalable and feature-rich solution aims to deliver a seamless experience for both users and administrators
